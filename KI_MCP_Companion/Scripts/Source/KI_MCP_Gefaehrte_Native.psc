Scriptname KI_MCP_Gefaehrte_Native Hidden
{Functions of KI_MCP_Gefaehrte.dll, the SKSE plugin of this mod. It reads what scripts cannot get at.
Its source is in its own repository (the fork of mantella-vanilla-dialogue, file plugin.cpp).
Without the DLL these functions do not exist. So ask SKSE.GetPluginVersion("KI_MCP_Gefaehrte") first,
as KI_MCP_Gefaehrte_Loop does.}
